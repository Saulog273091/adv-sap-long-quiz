## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).
- Service Oriented Architecture is a architecture that guides users in developing a software where they use the used components 
or services of the software to create something new.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
- There are 9 characteristics of SOA, the first one is Standardized Service Contrracts is the need to believe or follow a certain service description for the user's satisfaction.
Next one is Loose Coupling, where it needs to lessen the dependencies of a service to another to create boundaries with less vulnerability. 
Another is Abrastraction that hides unnecessary information to the client which might lead to confusion. 
Next is Service Reusability where they use an old service to create multiple new services. 
Another one is Autonomy which it needs to be precise when it comes to the logic to avoid misinformation or confusion. 
Next is Statelessness where it should not be too complicated so that it can be recycled or improved. 
Another one is Discoverability where the service should be easy to access to avoid unreliability. 
Next one is Composability which the services should be reliable in terms of solving problems with a composed process for it to be effecient. 
Last one is Interoperability which means that the service should be flexible in terms of other users.

3. Define Microservices.
- Microservices are architectures that makes reusable and new components but rather than making it in a single application, they create a new application with each component for the services be more flexible and spacewise.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
- There are 3 main benefits of using microservices, and the first one is microservices is independently deployable. Being an independent services lessens deadlocks when it comes with communication because of the bounderies that they have and due of the service having applications individually.
Second is it is Right tool for the job, where each services has it own application which is good for communication with minumum interferance. 
Lastly, it's Precise Scaling, as mentioned earlier that services can be individually deployed, then it can be monitored properly with minimum errors.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
- The difference of Service Oriented Architecture and Microservices is SOA is an enterprise-wide effort architecture which means that it works generally. On the other hand, Microservices is an application-specific that means it works specifically.
For the similarities of the two, both architectures reuse a component and create a new specialized component that helps a certain process.

6. Define Web Services.
- Web Services are services that are accessible from a software through the use of internet. Web services are commonly used in businesses because some of the business needs business processes that are flexible and accessible at the same time. They are used to exchange data between applications or systems.

7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.
- There are four benefits of using web services. Exposing the existing function on the
network, meaning your program will be easier to access to other application. With the help of HTTP or HyperText Transfer Protocol, other application can now access your program through a request that is more convenient compare to downloading a file.
Next is Interoperability, where it allows applications to communicate and share data and services that makes their platform and technology independent.
Another one Web services uses Standardized Protocol for communication, this gives businesses advantages when gathering information for their company.
Lastly Web services is Low Cost Communication that means you only need internet connection for communication and to implement your programs.

8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.
- There are 6 characteristics of Web Services, First One Web services are XML-Based which means it eliminates networking, operating system or even platform binding that makes the
application independent. Next one it is Loosely Coupled where if a consumer uses a web service, the consumer will not be confused because the web service is flexible to any users.
Next is Web services are Coarse-Grained, meaning that services are simplified and can be use through individual methods.
Another characteristics of Web Services is the Ability to be Synchronous or Asynchronouse where it can work both online and offline, online operations is where the client have to 
wait after the service is complete while in offline, the client will have to wait a longer period for the service to be completed.
Next is Web services Supports Remote Procedure Calls where clients can access the functions or methods of a service.
Last one is Web services Supports Document Exchange where they support transparent exchange of data or complex documents that helps their service be more accurate.

9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.
- There are three distinct roles in Web Services Architecture, first one is the Provider where he is the one creating the services in the web and makes it accessible to the client's end who wants to use it. 
Second, the Requestor is the client who needs the services and the one who is requesting to the provider.
Last is the Broker, is the application that helps clients to locate the web services.

10. List and discuss the Web Services Components.
- There are three Web Services Components. The first one is SOAP which means Simple Object Access Protocol, the one who is responsible in exchanging information between computers like applications or any operating system. Second is WSDL or Web Services Description Language is the one that describes webservices and teaches users how to access them. Next is UDDI or known as Universal Description, Discovery and Integration. It is a standard for publishing web services and using WSDL to describe interfaces to web services.
